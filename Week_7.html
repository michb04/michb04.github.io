      <h2>Reflecting on the Creative Process</h2>
      <p>
        The creative process is a dynamic journey involving various stages, from
        preperation to implementation. As I have gone through the term, I find
        myself engaging in these stages, shaping the development of my project
        on digital security and data privacy.
      </p>

      <h3>Preperation:</h3>
      <p>
        One of the early stages involves prepping and researching what I wanted
        to choose for my topic. Exploring the landscape of digital security and
        understanding its complexities it.
      </p>

      <h3>Incubation:</h3>
      <p>
        Is the idea of putting all the research I have gathered together to
        decide what will fit, this included examining different pieces of
        research.
      </p>

      <h3>Ideation:</h3>
      <p>
        Generating ideas is a crucial step. I've brainstormed various topics and
        narrowed down my focus to aspects like data privacy, cybersecurity, and
        proactive measures. This ideation process helped define the scope and
        objectives of my website.
      </p>

      <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the idea of going over the chosen topic and deciding if the
        topic is the right one by asking questions such as is this a website
        that people would find informative and look at and if there is already
        websites like this out there and if so is there too many already?
      </p>

      <h3>implementation:</h3>
      <p>
        Bringing ideas to life is where design thinking starts. Understanding
        the needs of my audience, planning narrative structures, and integrating
        multimedia elements align with the principles of design thinking. It's
        about creating a user-centric and engaging experience.

      <h2>Lab task</h2>
      <p>
        I have chosen not to add any audio to my site to prioritise user
        experience and accessibility. While audio can enhance certain aspects of
        a website, it may pose challenges for users, especially those who rely
        on screen readers, have hearing impairments, or prefer to browse withno
        disruptive sounds e.g. someone who has autism and finds it challenging
        with so much noise sensory. By excluding audio I am ensuring that my
        website remains accessible to all audiences that use the web.
