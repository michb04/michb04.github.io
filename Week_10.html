        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <p>Creating an accessible website ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content effectively. Here are key factors that contribute to website accessibility:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content (Alt Text):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide alternative text for images, graphics, and multimedia elements. This helps users with visual impairments understand the content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Semantic HTML:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use proper HTML elements to structure content. For example, use headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) to outline the document structure, enhancing navigation for screen readers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Keyboard Accessibility:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that all functionality is operable using a keyboard. Users with motor disabilities may rely on keyboard navigation instead of a mouse.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Descriptive Links:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write clear and descriptive link text. Avoid using generic terms like "click here." This benefits users who navigate through links using screen readers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background to enhance readability, especially for users with visual impairments or color blindness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Readable Text:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use legible fonts and provide options for users to adjust text size. This benefits users with visual impairments or those who require larger text for readability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Captions and Transcripts:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include captions for videos and transcripts for audio content. This supports users with hearing impairments and ensures the information is accessible to a broader audience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Consistent Navigation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep a consistent and predictable navigation structure across the website. This helps users, including those with cognitive disabilities, easily understand and navigate the content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
