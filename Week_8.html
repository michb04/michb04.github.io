      <h2>Lab task</h2>
      <p>
        I have chosen not to add any audio to my site to prioritise user
        experience and accessibility. While audio can enhance certain aspects of
        a website, it may pose challenges for users, especially those who rely
        on screen readers, have hearing impairments, or prefer to browse withno
        disruptive sounds e.g. someone who has autism and finds it challenging
        with so much noise sensory. By excluding audio I am ensuring that my
        website remains accessible to all audiences that use the web.
