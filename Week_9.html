      <h2>Task 1</h2>
      <p>
        I also chose not to include videos in my site due to the same issues
        with accessibility but also page loading times and bandwith
        considerations. Videos, especially high-res or lengthy ones, can
        significantly increase the amount of time it takes for the page load
        meaning that users with slower wifis could extend waiting times. Some
        people also may be on limited data plansmeaning that they want to
        conserve their dat. Not including videos makes the site more user
        friendly. Even if there are benefits which would make it more
        informative.
