    <title>Secure digital security and data privacy</title>
    <section class="task-introduction">
        <h2>Task 1: Choosing my topic</h2>
        <p>The topic I have chosen is the importance of digital security and data privacy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="task2-section">
        <h2> Task 2: Narrowing down focus</h2>
        <p>I chose this topic because I want my website to answer questions on the aspects of why it is so important to have things like strong passowrds and encryption technologies and what sort of online threats are pretty common which could be prevented by this.</p>
        <p>Some keywords I used in my searches were "data privacy, cybersecurity, online privacy and digital threats"</p>
        <p>Some of my final thoughts were that this topic requires a balance between broad understanding and specific focus as companies may be an audience for this but also people who dont know too much about technology.</p>
